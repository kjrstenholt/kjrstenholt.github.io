    <h1>Using the gestalt principles of perception</h1>

    <p>The gestalt psychologists of the early twentieth century were fascinated with the mind's ability to see unified "wholes" from the sum of complex visual parts ("Gestalt" is German for "whole form"). Their research into the perception of visual patterns yielded a number of consistent principles that dominate human visual reasoning and pattern recognition, and these principles form the theoretical basis for much of modern graphic design. The following principles are those most relevant to web page design: </p>

    <p>1. Proximity: Elements that are close to each other are perceived as more related than elements that lie farther apart.</p>

    <p>2. Similarity: Viewers will associate (and treat as a group) elements that share consistent visual characteristics.</p>

    <p>3. Continuity: We prefer continuous, unbroken contours and paths. Our mind will fill them in if they are suggested.</p>

    <p>4. Closure: We have a powerful bias to see completed figures, even when the contours of the figure are broken or ambiguous.</p>
